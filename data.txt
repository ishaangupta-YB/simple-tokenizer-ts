Final check: naïve façade coöperate — does it tokenize correctly? ✅

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This sentence contains every letter of the alphabet.
Programming languages like Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Rust are widely used today.
Machine learning models require tokenization to process natural language text effectively.

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens.
These tokens can be words, subwords, or even individual characters depending on the approach.
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is one of the most popular subword tokenization algorithms.
It works by iteratively merging the most frequent pairs of characters or character sequences.

The transformer architecture, introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need", revolutionized NLP.
Large language models like GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA use subword tokenization for efficiency.
The vocabulary size is typically between 30,000 and 100,000 tokens for modern LLMs.

Common words like "the", "and", "is", "to", "of", "a", "in", "that", "it", "for" appear frequently.
Less common words get split into subwords: "tokenization" might become "token" + "ization".
This approach handles out-of-vocabulary words gracefully without needing a special unknown token.

Different languages contribute to vocabulary diversity:
French: Bonjour, comment allez-vous? Je m'appelle Claude.
German: Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen? Maschinelles Lernen ist faszinierend.
Spanish: Hola, ¿cómo estás? El procesamiento del lenguaje natural es interesante.
Japanese: こんにちは、お元気ですか？自然言語処理は面白いです。
Chinese: 你好，你好吗？自然语言处理非常有趣。
Korean: 안녕하세요, 어떻게 지내세요? 자연어 처리는 흥미롭습니다.
